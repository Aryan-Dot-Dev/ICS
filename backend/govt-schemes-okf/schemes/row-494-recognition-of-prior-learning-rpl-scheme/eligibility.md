## Structured eligibility rules

The rule block below is a domain-specific extension of this bundle, not a
claim that OKF v0.2 defines it.

```yaml
eligibility_rules:
  all:
    - rule_id: CTZ-001
      field: applicant.citizenship
      operator: equals
      value: "IN"
      type: hard
      source: S1
      confidence: medium
      detail: "There is no minimum educational qualification required, and the scheme is open to all Indian citizens."
```

## Missing information handling

If the engine cannot establish the following, emit
`status: needs_information` and request exactly these fields — do not
infer:

```yaml
status: needs_information
missing_fields:
  - applicant.citizenship
```

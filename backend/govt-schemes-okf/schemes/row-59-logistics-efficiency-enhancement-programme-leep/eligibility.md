## Structured eligibility rules

The rule block below is a domain-specific extension of this bundle, not a
claim that OKF v0.2 defines it.

_No deterministic rule could be extracted from the source text with sufficient confidence._ `eligibility_rules.all: []` — the engine must not infer rules; evaluate against the dimension evidence above and request the missing fields below.

```yaml
eligibility_rules:
  all: []
```

## Missing information handling

If the engine cannot establish the following, emit
`status: needs_information` and request exactly these fields — do not
infer:

```yaml
status: needs_information
missing_fields:
  - applicant.age
  - applicant.business.type
```
